The aim of gimie is to extract project metadata in an interoperable format. This is achieved by generating [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) following the widely used [schema.org](http://schema.org) ontology. The resulting metadata can readily be augmented or integrated with other data sources.

Gimie's output follows recommendations provided by the [codemeta project](https://codemeta.github.io/), but also provides additional properties.
